This package includes several commandline tools for interacting with the
test system from a remote machine.

To use this package, first ensure you have SOAP::Lite installed if you
don't already, then simply invoke the scripts.

   stp-lshost        # lists the STP hosts
   stp-lsimage       # lists the distros
   stp-lstest        # lists the tests
   stp-trsearch      # searches the test results
   stp-trget IDNUM   # retrieves data for a test request

The first four can be run with no parameters; for the fifth you give it
the test request ID number.

All of the scripts have manpages, which you can access by calling them
with the --man option.  For example, `stp-trsearch --man`.  This will
explain additional parameters each tool supports.
