This is the README file for WebService::TestSystem, a program that
implements a distributed testing system using the SOAP protocol.  This
system is designed to provide a uniform API that multiple kinds of
front ends can access (web, commandline, GUI, email, etc.) that provides
access to various testing services (STP, PLM, Tinderbox, etc.) 

For more information on how to use the script, see the
pod documentation via the command
  perldoc WebService::TestSystem
or, after installation, view the man pages with
  man WebService::TestSystem

For instructions on how to install the script, see the
file INSTALL.

Problems, questions, etc. may be sent to bryce@osdl.org
