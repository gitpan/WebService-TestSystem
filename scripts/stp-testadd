# stp-testadd - adds a new test to STP
#
# params:  
#    * test code tarball or bk location
#    * name of the test
#    * Valid options allowed
#       + description
#       + default
#       + format
#    * Additional documents, such as the test's website
#    * Name of the person maintaining the test
#    * Author's name

# ALGORITHM:
# If user provided it as a tarball
#   Need to add it to bk...?  TODO

# At this point we assume the test code is in bk marked with
# tag 'stp_deploy'.  Probably we should investigate pulling tests 
# from PLM or something...

# Submit the test information to the database
#  $soap->add_test($testsys, $testname, \%properties);

# print "Test '$testname' has been successfully added to STP\n";
